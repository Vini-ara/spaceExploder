# spaceExploder

This project is a terminal game written in c using the ncurses library.

## Overview

The game consists in a spaceship traveling space and trying not to colide with an asteroid. The ship fires missiles at a fixed rate, and the meteors 
spawn more and get faster as the game progresses. The goal is to survive as much as possible. The score is based on how much you have survived.

## Play the game

To play the game you need to clone the repository and `cd` into the directory created, then run the comand 

`bash comp.sh` 

Now there should appear a `game` file in the directory. Now you just need to run this file:

`./game`
